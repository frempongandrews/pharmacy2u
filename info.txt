My motivations:

To begin with, I want to thank you for the opportunity given me to take the test.

The following are some of my motivations for doing what I did in the test.

- I am given an entry.scss for styling.
I decided to leave use the entry.scss for resetting the browsers styles using
the Eric Meyers reset. Styled components is the industry standard due to the 
styles being scoped to that specific component and zero risk of class name 
clashes which can make debugging css very hard.

Possible improvements:
- Use of typescript: typescript is synonym of less bugs
- little things in the UI: There were a few artifacts in the UI that simply needed more time.
- Testing: I would have used React testing library and stub a few of the props for the Show and ShowList components
to check if they render properly
