My motivations:

To begin with, I want to thank you for the opportunity given me to take the test.

The following are some of my motivations for doing what I did in the test.

- Can the project setup be changed?
I decided to stick with the default setup. Normally I would use a bundler like webpack(the industry standard) to setup a project like this.
Unfamiliarity with browserify means more time to research and learn how to accomplish the same results attainable with webpack.

- I am given an entry.scss for styling. Can I style the App in another way?
I decided to leave use the entry.scss for resetting the browsers styles using
the Eric Meyers reset. Styled components is the industry standard due to the 
styles being scoped to that specific component and zero risk of class name 
clashes which can make debugging css very hard.


Features not implemented due to time:
- Show detail info in modal


Possible improvements:
- optimization using localstorage: I partially implemented caching for the first load of shows. Can be improved to include
the other days as well
- Use of typescript: typescript is synonym of less bugs
- little things in the UI: There were a few artifacts in the UI that simply needed more time.
- Testing: I would have used React testing library and stub a few of the props for the Show and ShowList components
to check if they render properly
